# CNAKE

> A snake clone for terminals written from scratch without any libraries

Implementing snake in the terminal would be much easier with ncurses, but
this is more of an experiment to see what can be done with ansi escape codes.

Tested on GNU/Linux, MacOS and Windows WSL and it works surprisingly well.

```
$ gcc -o cnake *.c
$ ./cnake
```
